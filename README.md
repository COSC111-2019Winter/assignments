## assignment01
Welcome to cosc 111 and this is your first assignment submission! In this assignment, our goal is to know how to upload your files to your GitHub assignment repository. Your GitHub assignment01 repository should be named as "**assignment01-*your_github_username***". If you don't know where is your assignment repository, you can go to our class GitHub website: [https://github.com/cosc111-2019winter](https://github.com/cosc111-2019winter) to look for your repositories. You can only see public repositories, like "**assignments**" and your own repositories.

Once you find and open your assignment01 repository, you can upload a file to the repository, by clicking "Upload files" in the webpage.

Now let's prepare a text file to upload for your first assignment. On Mac, open TextEdit to create a text file. If you don't know how to create a text file, follow the guide [here](https://sjiang1.github.io/classes/java1/19winter/lec01.4.appendix.html).

In the text file, write your name, your email address, your EID, and your github username. Save the file with the name: assignment01.txt

Upload the text file to your GitHub webpage by dragging the file to the webpage or click "choose your files."

Finally, the **most important step is to click the green "Commit changes"** so that the file is really uploaded to your repository.

Always check your repository webpage after you submit the file to see if the file is really there.

Once your file is uploaded to the repository, you can click the file link to see the content of the file.
